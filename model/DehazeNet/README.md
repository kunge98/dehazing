Run create_dataset.py to create a training dataset.   
Run DehazeNet-pytorch.py.train() to train a model.   
Run DehazeNet-pytorch.py.defog() to defog a picture.   
The model is trained on GPU and defog() is run on CPU.  

The model I trained didn't work well.  
In the paper, 'To refine the transmission map, guided image filtering [15] is used to smooth the image.', but I did't do it.
